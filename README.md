Here you'll find of interesting coding/algorithmic/data structures problems that I have solved, the topics include :

1.  Dynamic Programming(42) - Bitmasking DP, DP on trees, Edit Distance, Coin Change, Longest Common Sequence, Largest Palindromic Sequence                               in a string and a LOT of Contest Problems.
2.  Graph Problems(31)- BFS, DFS Bellman Ford, Exponential Shortest Path(Recursive), Dijkstra, 2 Edge/Vertex Connectivity in Graph, Kahn's                         Algorithm, Tarjan's Algorithm and many Contest Problems, Strong Connectivity, Transitive Closure and Contest                               Problems which are difficult to describle in one word :)
3.  Hashing - Universal hashing, Collision Handling, STL implemetation of unordered_sets/maps.
4.  Data Stuctures - All trivial one(Trees, GRaphs, stacks...) and these : Segment Trees(Minimum range Query, Lazy Propagation), Disjoint                        Sets.
5.  Backtracking(5) - Knight's Tour, m-Colouring Problem, Queen's Problem...


My personal favourite is DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING and GRAPHS.
