Here you'll find of interesting coding/algorithmic/data structures problems that I have solved, the topics include :

1.  Dynamic Programming(42) - Bitmasking DP, DP on trees, Edit Distance, Coin Change, Longest Common Sequence, Largest Palindromic Sequence                               in a string and a LOT of Contest Problems.
2.  Graph Problems(31)- BFS, DFS Bellman Ford, Exponential Shortest Path(Recursive), Dijkstra, 2 Edge/Vertex Connectivity in Graph, Kahn's                         Algorithm, Tarjan's Algorithm, Strong Connectivity, Transitive Closure and Contest                                                         Problems which are difficult to describle in one word :)

4.  Data Stuctures - All trivial one(Trees, Graphs, stacks, queues, hashing...) and Segment Trees(Minimum range Query, Lazy Propagation),                        Disjoint Sets.
5.  Backtracking(5) - Knight's Tour, m-Colouring Problem, Queen's Problem...


My personal favourite is Dynamic Programming and Graphs.
